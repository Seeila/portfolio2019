        <Intro>
          I am a Belgian, mostly self-taught, Front-End Developer, who, on top
          of beers and fries, loves to making live beautiful designs.
        </Intro>

        <P>
          After 3 years as Graphic Graphic Designer, I have decided to make a
          change of career and become a <strong>Front-End developer</strong>.
          Later, I was one of the 2000 of 200.000 selected for a{" "}
          <strong>Google Scholarship</strong> to follow Udacity Front-End
          Nanodregree. At the same time, I was working part time as a Web
          Integrator and all my free time was spent on Udacity.
        </P>
        <P>
          After having graduated, I moved to another agency and became a
          Front-End Developer and worked on different projects, be it a loan
          simulator or and national railway company.
        </P>
